Named Entity Recognition system
Requies Tomita-parser (https://github.com/yandex/tomita-parser or https://tech.yandex.ru/tomita). Python scripts were optimized for python 3.4.

## Abstract to paper
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key subtask of information extraction and NLP. Its
purport is detection and labelling atomic pieces of text with tags from pre-defined set.
This paper presents information about problem of proper entity recognition and describes
main approaches to building systems which solve it. The study also includes implementation
of NER system for using in Russian-language news articles. The distinctive feature of the
algorithm is using information extracted from Wikipedia articles (i.e. consideration Wikipedia
as the knowledge base) in combination with labelling based on using context-free grammars.
In this connection the paper describes, inter alia, concept of knowledge base and its relation to
information extraction tasks. Tomita-parser by Yandex was used as the tool for text parsing.
